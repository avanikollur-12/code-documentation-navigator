# Features – Code Documentation Navigator

## Overview
Code Documentation Navigator provides intelligent tools that help developers understand, explore, and navigate large codebases using natural language queries.

---

## Core Features

### Natural Language Code Queries
- Ask questions about the codebase in plain English.
- Example: “What does this repository do?” or “Explain this function.”

### Semantic Code Search
- Uses embeddings to search code based on meaning, not keywords.
- Retrieves the most relevant code snippets for a given query.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Combines retrieved code context with a language model.
- Ensures answers are accurate and grounded in source code.

### Faster Developer Onboarding
- Helps new developers understand unfamiliar repositories quickly.
- Reduces time spent manually reading files and documentation.

### Scalable to Large Repositories
- Designed to work efficiently with large and complex GitHub projects.
