Code Documentation Navigator

The Navigator leverages Python and Streamlit to provide an interactive interface where users can upload their Python scripts and instantly get a navigated version of the code. It parses the code, identifies key elements like functions, classes, and comments, and presents them in an organized format. This helps users:

Quickly understand unfamiliar code

Improve code readability and documentation

Save time during code review and learning

With a simple setup, the Code Documentation Navigator transforms any Python file into a visually navigable format, making code comprehension faster, easier, and more intuitive.
Practical Application

A zip file named Code_navigator.zip is provided which contains:

app.py

parser.py

README.py

Setup Instructions:

[Code_navigator.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25013376/Code_navigator.zip)

Save the zip file on your system and extract it.

Ensure Python 3.11.9 (64-bit) is installed and the path is defined.

Steps to Use Code Navigator:

Open Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt.

Navigate to the extracted folder:

Run the Streamlit app:

Copy the two lines given below:

cd C:\Code_navigator

streamlit run app.py


A local host page will open in your browser.

Upload your Python code using the interface.

Click on Analyze Code.

The analyzed and navigated Python code will be displayed!
