##Code Documentation Navigator:
      The Navigator leverages Python and Streamlit to provide an interactive interface where users can upload their Python scripts and instantly get a navigated version of the code. It parses the code, identifies key elements like functions, classes, and comments, and presents them in an organized format. This helps users:

1.Quickly understand unfamiliar code

2.Improve code readability and documentation

3.Save time during code review and learning

4.With a simple setup, the Code Documentation Navigator transforms any Python file into a visually navigable format, making code comprehension faster, easier, and more intuitive.

##Practical Application
[Code_navigator.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25013376/Code_navigator.zip)
A zip file named Code_navigator is given which contains:
1.app.py
2.parser.py
3.README.py
4.Save the zip file in your systems,
5.Make sure Python 3.11.9(64-bits) is installed and path defined in the check box


Follow the below mentioned steps to use the Code Navigator:
1. Open Windows Powershell/ Command Prompt
2. Type: "C:\Code_navigator"
3. Streamlit run app.py
4. A local host opens
5. Float your python code
6. Click on "Analyze code"
7. The analyzed navigated python code is displayed!!
